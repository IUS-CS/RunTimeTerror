Our project’s name is Jumpman Plumber and is similar to the Super Mario Bros game. However, we are designing the game a little differently. In our game, there is one character that represents the user while playing. The game will begin with the character moving from left to right along the screen. To get the character to move, you will use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. The goal of the game is for the character to stay alive and not die before reaching the end of the game. However, there will be obstacles throughout the game that you (the player) will have to pass in order to win. These obstacles consist of platforming, jumping, enemy avoidance, and things of that nature. 

The game will be written in Java and have multiple graphic components. Upon playing, users will utilize the left, right, and "x keys to navigate. In our case, the "x" key is used for jumping. As you move the character throughout the game, the player faces new obstacles. If the player does not make it past an obstacle, he or she will die and be prompted with a "You die" message. However, the player will be given the chance to "Try again". To close, the player will know that they have won the game as soon as they cross the finish line and are prompted with a “You won" message.
