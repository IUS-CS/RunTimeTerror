### Requirements and Information Regarding our Project

**1. Project Title**

  **1.1** Jumpman Plumber: Our game is named this in resemblance to the Super Mario game. Mario was a plumber and our character jumps through the game with the task of enemy avoidance.


**2. Project Overview**

  **2.1** Project Concept: The concept of our project is to create a game that users can interact with. There are enemies in our game that you, the main character, has to avoid. These enemies come out of pipes located at the top of the game screen. If an enemy makes it all the way to the bottom of the game screen without dying then they will enter the pipes located at the bottom and return to pipes located at the top of the screen to be redistributed. As the main character, you are challenged with the task of finishing the game without being hit by one of the enemies. If you are hit by an enemy, you lose the game will have to try again, as you are only granted one "life". 

**2.2** Gameflow Structure: The user (main character) navigates through our game using the left and right arrow keys located on their keyboard. To jump and avoid enemies, they will need to press the "x" button located on their keyboard. In order to launch themselves to the right, they will need to simultaneously push the right arrow key and the "x" key. To launch thmeselves to the left, they will need to simultaneously push the left arrow key and the "x" key. To conclude, these are the only keys the user will need to navigate through the game successfully.

**2.3** Challenge Structure: The challenge structure of our game is the distribution of enemies. Currently, we have two enemies named Goomba and Koopa. These enemies are distributed from the pipes located at the top of the screen. As time progresses, these enemies get more plentiful which makes for a much more difficult game.

**2.4** Look and Feel: Our game will resemble an "old-school" feel as we have a black background and green platforms. In addition, the main character and enemies are represented using tradional shapes to follow the old-school trend.
