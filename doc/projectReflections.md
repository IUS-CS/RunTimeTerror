<h2> Will's Reflection: </h2>



<h2> Amanda's Reflection: </h2>
	
	To say this project flew by would be an understatement and even though we didn’t get as far as we would’ve liked, &nbsp;I believe we all learned a lot in the process. Throughout the project timeline, I made sure to keep our documentation in the Project’s tab up-to-date so that each member knew what was expected of us for each sprint. I also made sure that each of the documentation requirements were satisfied whether that meant creating UML diagrams for our project or specifying the types of test we were to complete in our project. 

	Looking back, if I could change one thing, I would change the way we went about our project. At the beginning, we divided up the work so that I always did the documentation and Will always did the coding with Kaitlin helping him with tests and certain features. We decided that it would be best to work this way and then cross paths whenever needed. This worked out fairly well besides the fact that I didn’t get as much experience coding as I would’ve liked, and Kaitlin didn’t have very much contribution to our project. To pinpoint what could’ve gone better, I would have to say that our communication could’ve been better. Each week we would check in with each other after class or via text and everyone would be doing good but then when Wednesday rolled around, it seemed as if at the end of each sprint, we would have Kaitlin unable to contribute to our project. This made it very hard for us to work as a group because we never knew what she was working on or if it would be finished by the next sprint. However, even though I cannot speak for her, I do believe that even though her commits are low, she was able to learn some information from Will and I when we met with her one-on-one. 

	To close, this project taught me the importance of documentation, communication, and time management. Even though we weren’t able to budget enough time to create fun images and a “Mario” character, we used our time to instead, focus on our main features, run tests over what we already had, and create proper documentation.
