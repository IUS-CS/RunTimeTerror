<h1> Project Reflections </h1>

<h2> Will's Reflection: </h2>
This project started out in a very interesting manner. First there was the issue of figuring out just what we were going to build. Then there was the issue of figuring out, who would be doing what in the project. We had initially divided this up with Amanda doing mostly documentation, Kaitlyn doing mostly unit testing, and myself doing mostly programming. This however changed right out the gate.

The first sprint, we had changed the divide to give Kaitlyn some programming and we each do some unit testing. Looking back, this split was a bad call. We should have split it where all three had some of each, writing the documentation for the code we wrote and the document lead writing up group stuff. 

Amanda and I had to step up and fill the lack of work that Kaitlyn had been putting forward. This was first noticed when she hadn’t done anything for sprint 1. We managed to complete the sprint still, but after we covered the stuff that wasn’t done. We then tried doing one on ones with her and see if maybe she was just having issues with git and could get her going after that. With each sprint we did, we tried to meet up as a group and discuss in a sort of standup what we will be doing in the next week. This led to Kaitlyn finding issues with every time we proposed to meet up. 

By the end of the project, I don’t think Kaitlyn turned anything in on the project. This meant that really it was just Amanda and I making the program, we ended up dividing it up with her doing documentation and me writing the code. The overall experience led to learning how to work with Jframe and how to build code with testability in mind.

To say this project flew by would be an understatement and even though we didn’t get as far as we would’ve liked, I believe we all learned a lot in the process. Throughout the project timeline, I made sure to keep our documentation in the Project’s tab up-to-date so that each member knew what was expected of us for each sprint. I also made sure that each of the documentation requirements were satisfied whether that meant creating UML diagrams for our project or specifying the types of test we were to complete in our project. 

Looking back, if I could change one thing, I would change the way we went about our project. At the beginning, we divided up the work so that I always did the documentation and Will always did the coding with Kaitlin helping him with tests and certain features. We decided that it would be best to work this way and then cross paths whenever needed. This worked out fairly well besides the fact that I didn’t get as much experience coding as I would’ve liked, and Kaitlin didn’t have very much contribution to our project. To pinpoint what could’ve gone better, I would have to say that our communication could’ve been better. Each week we would check in with each other after class or via text and everyone would be doing good but then when Wednesday rolled around, it seemed as if at the end of each sprint, we would have Kaitlin unable to contribute to our project. This made it very hard for us to work as a group because we never knew what she was working on or if it would be finished by the next sprint. However, even though I cannot speak for her, I do believe that even though her commits are low, she was able to learn some information from Will and I when we met with her one-on-one. 

To close, this project taught me the importance of documentation, communication, and time management. Even though we weren’t able to budget enough time to create fun images and a “Mario” character, we used our time to instead, focus on our main features, run tests over what we already had, and create proper documentation.

Creating this project with my fellow partners was good experience for me using jframe and designing a game. First thing I learned from this was that managing my time when creating this game is the number 1 priority. Time is crucial when it comes to wanting to complete a project one step at a time. While working on the project, we created objects(enemies in the game) to move around in the game and trying to figure out how to collide with other enemies without the enemies killing eachother. I created one of the enemies to move around and collide. Testing this was a challenge for me but with my teamates code testing examples, I soon understood what they were doing. Now that I have experience with creating a game using jframe , I can use that knowledge of jframe to create projects for future reference
