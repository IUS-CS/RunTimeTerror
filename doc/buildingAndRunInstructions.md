<h2>The process on how to build and run this project will be done IntelliJ </h2>

•	The first step in building our project is cloning the repository from our master branch

•	Next, you will need to open IntelliJ on your computer and create a new project. 

• Once you have created a new project, you will then go to the tab titled "VCS" and click "Check out from version control" and then choose "Git"

•	From there, you will need to paste the URL you copied from our repository in step one

•	After pasting the URL, you will create the project 

•	The next step you will need to do is import the maven dependencies (a pop-up should appear at the bottom right of your screen)

•	Finally, the last step in building our project is navigating to the "Game" class and right clicking on it

•	Once you right click, you will push the green "Run" button to run our game

<b>Congrats, you are now finished! Enjoy our game!</b>
